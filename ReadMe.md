# Application notes

You will start in the centre, the camera will constantly be looking you.

There is another two cubes in the scene. One to the right is the target cube, and one that will be following you every more and rotation

There is also some text at the top left. 
The floating point numbers represent the angle between your cubes facing vector and the static cube, and the text below will tell you if the static cube is to the left or right of you.

# Application Controls

WASD == Control the movement of the cube.
QE   == Rotate on the Y axis
Arrows Keys == Rotate on X and Z axis
